# Spaceship

A small shooting game made almost entirely using Reactive programming with RxJs. I made this to practice my RxJs skills after reading *Reactive Programming with RxJs* ~ Sergi Mansilla

## How to play
- Move cursor left or right to move your spaceship
- Mouse click to shoot
- That's all. You're welcome
